# CTAS-compliant triage classification
def classify_medical_urgency(symptoms: str) -> TriageResult:
    """
    Classifies patient urgency using CTAS protocols
    
    Returns:
        urgency_level: 'RED' | 'YELLOW' | 'GREEN'
        confidence: float (0.0 - 1.0)
        recommended_action: str
        requires_human_review: bool
    """
    # Never provides medical diagnosis
