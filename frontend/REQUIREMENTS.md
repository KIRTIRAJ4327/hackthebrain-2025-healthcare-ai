## ‚ö° Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install Flutter
```bash
# Windows (using Git Bash or PowerShell)
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"

# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install flutter

# Verify installation
flutter doctor
```

### Step 2: Clone & Setup Project
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/hackthebrain-2025-healthcare-ai.git
cd hackthebrain-2025-healthcare-ai

# Navigate to frontend (IMPORTANT!)
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Verify setup
flutter analyze
```

### Step 3: Run Application
```bash
# Start development server
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000

# Expected result: Browser opens to Healthcare AI splash screen
# Terminal shows: ‚úÖ Firebase initialized successfully
```

## üéØ Development Environment Verification

### ‚úÖ Success Checklist
Run these commands to verify your setup:

```bash
# Check Flutter installation
flutter doctor -v
# Should show: ‚úÖ Flutter, ‚úÖ Chrome, ‚úÖ VS Code

# Check project dependencies
cd frontend && flutter pub deps
# Should show: All dependencies resolved

# Run tests
flutter test
# Should show: All tests passed!

# Launch app
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000
# Should show: Healthcare AI splash screen
```

### üö® Common Setup Issues

#### Issue: Flutter command not found
```bash
# Solution: Add Flutter to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/flutter/bin"
# Or restart terminal after installation
```

#### Issue: Chrome not detected
```bash
# Solution: Install Chrome or use different browser
flutter run -d edge  # Windows
flutter run -d safari  # macOS
```

#### Issue: pubspec.yaml not found
```bash
# Solution: Ensure you're in frontend directory
cd frontend
flutter pub get
```
