# 🏥 Healthcare AI - Team Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start for Team Members

### ✅ Prerequisites
Ensure you have these installed before starting:

```bash
# Required Software
- Node.js 18+ (for package management)
- Flutter SDK 3.32.4+ (latest stable)
- Git (for version control)
- Chrome browser (for web development)
- VS Code or Android Studio (recommended IDEs)
```

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/hackthebrain-2025-healthcare-ai.git
cd hackthebrain-2025-healthcare-ai
```

#### 2. Navigate to Frontend Directory
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Always work from the frontend directory
cd frontend
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Get Flutter packages
flutter pub get

# Verify installation
flutter doctor
```

#### 4. Run the Application
```bash
# Start development server (MUST be in frontend/ directory)
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000

# Alternative ports if 3000 is busy
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3001
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3002
```

#### 5. Verify Success
- Browser opens to `http://localhost:3000/#/splash`
- See Healthcare AI splash screen with blue medical theme
- Terminal shows: `✅ Firebase initialized successfully`

## 🛠 Development Workflow

### Daily Development Commands
```bash
# Always start in the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Clean and restart if needed
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000

# Run tests
flutter test

# Check for issues
flutter analyze
```

### 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "No pubspec.yaml file found"
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the `frontend/` directory
```bash
cd frontend  # Navigate to correct directory
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000
```

#### Issue: "Port already in use"
**Solution**: Use a different port or kill existing processes
```bash
# Use different port
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3001

# Or kill existing processes (Windows)
taskkill /F /IM dart.exe
```

#### Issue: Firebase errors in development
**Solution**: Firebase is configured - errors are normal in dev environment
- Ignore Firebase warnings during development
- Focus on UI/UX implementation first
