# HackTheBrain 2025 - System Test Scenarios

## üß™ Evidence-Based Data Testing

Before pushing to GitHub, let's verify all our improvements work correctly!

## ‚úÖ **TEST 1: Evidence-Based Wait Times**

### What to Test:
- Capacity simulation uses official government data
- Emergency wait times: 3-5 hours (not 4.5 hours from personal experience)
- Urgent care: 1-2 hours
- Walk-in clinics: 30-90 minutes

### How to Test:
```bash
cd frontend
flutter run
# Navigate to: Providers ‚Üí Find Healthcare 
# Check wait time data in console output
```

**Expected Results**:
- Emergency: 180-300 minutes (3-5 hours)
- Console shows: "Health Quality Ontario Aug 2024" references
- No mention of "personal experience"

## ‚úÖ **TEST 2: Specialist Availability Service**

### Scenario: "15 cardio appointments cancelled"
1. **Navigate to**: Triage ‚Üí Medical AI
2. **Enter symptoms**: "chest pain, shortness of breath"
3. **Check result**: Should recommend cardiology specialist
4. **Verify**: Alternative specialist finder activates

### What to Verify:
- Uses ICES/CIHI research data (33-76 days ‚Üí 3-14 days)
- Shows "time saved" calculations
- Displays real hospital names (UHN, Mount Sinai, Unity Health)
- Evidence-based urgency protocols

**Expected Console Output**:
```
üîÑ Finding alternative cardiology specialist...
‚úÖ Found alternative: Dr. Sarah Chen at Mount Sinai Hospital
‚è∞ Time saved: 27 days (30 ‚Üí 3 days)
```

---

## ‚úÖ **TEST 3: Real Hospital Data Integration**

### What to Test:
- GTA Map shows actual hospitals
- Real addresses and coordinates
- Specialties match real capabilities

### How to Test:
1. **Navigate to**: Providers ‚Üí GTA Healthcare Map
2. **Verify hospitals**: 
   - Toronto General Hospital (200 Elizabeth St)
   - Mount Sinai Hospital (600 University Ave)
   - Unity Health - St. Michael's (30 Bond St)

**Expected Results**:
- Accurate coordinates
- Real specialty listings
- Government data citations in console

## ‚úÖ **TEST 4: Medical AI with Evidence-Based Triage**

### Test Cases:

#### **Critical Case** (CTAS 1):
- **Symptoms**: "severe chest pain, can't breathe, sweating"
- **Expected**: Immediate emergency recommendation
- **Wait Reduction**: From 4.7 hours ‚Üí immediate

#### **Urgent Case** (CTAS 2):
- **Symptoms**: "moderate chest pain, concerned about heart"
- **Expected**: Urgent care recommendation with specialist referral
- **Wait Reduction**: From 3.2 hours ‚Üí 1-2 hours

#### **Semi-Urgent Case** (CTAS 3):
- **Symptoms**: "minor injury, cut on hand"
- **Expected**: Walk-in clinic recommendation
- **Wait Reduction**: From 3.2 hours ‚Üí 30-90 minutes

### How to Test:
1. **Navigate to**: Triage ‚Üí Healthcare AI
2. **Test each scenario** above
3. **Verify citations**: Console shows official data sources

---

## ‚úÖ **TEST 5: System Load Balancing**

### What to Test:
- Capacity simulation with evidence-based multipliers
- Real-time system health monitoring
- Traffic-aware routing

### How to Test:
1. **Navigate to**: Dashboard ‚Üí Healthcare Coordination
2. **Check metrics**: System load, wait times, alerts
3. **Verify calculations**: Based on CIHI/HQO data

**Expected Features**:
- Monday madness: +40% load
- Rush hour: +120% travel time
- Evidence-based threshold alerts

---

## ‚úÖ **TEST 6: Data Source Verification**

### Critical Check:
**All console output should reference**:
- ‚úÖ Health Quality Ontario (Aug 2024)
- ‚úÖ CIHI NACRS data (2024)
- ‚úÖ ICES Ontario Study (2014)
- ‚úÖ Canadian Family Physician (2020)
- ‚ùå NO personal experience mentions

### Verification Commands:
```bash
# Search for old personal references
grep -r "personal experience" frontend/lib/
grep -r "4.5 hours" frontend/lib/

# Should find ONLY new evidence-based references
grep -r "Health Quality Ontario" frontend/lib/
grep -r "CIHI" frontend/lib/
```

## üéØ **COMPETITION DEMO SCENARIOS**

### **Scenario A: Emergency Cardiac Event**
1. **Start**: Patient reports chest pain
2. **AI Triage**: Identifies CTAS 1 (critical)
3. **System**: Finds nearest cardiac center (Peter Munk)
4. **Result**: "Redirected from 4.7-hour ER wait to immediate cardiac care"

### **Scenario B: Cancelled Specialist Appointments**
1. **Problem**: 15 cardiology appointments cancelled at Toronto General
2. **System**: Searches all GTA hospitals with cardiology
3. **Solution**: Finds Dr. Chen at Mount Sinai, available in 3 days
4. **Impact**: "27 days saved vs original 30-day wait"

### **Scenario C: System-Wide Optimization**
1. **Alert**: Multiple hospitals at capacity
2. **Action**: Auto-redirect to underutilized facilities
3. **Result**: "Province-wide load balancing reduces delays"
