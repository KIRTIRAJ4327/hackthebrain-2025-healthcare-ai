# üß† Smart Booking Logic System - Complete Scenario Guide

## Overview
The Smart Booking Logic System ensures **medically appropriate** booking decisions based on Canadian Triage & Acuity Scale (CTAS) levels and symptom severity. The core principle: **higher severity = fewer booking options**.

## üéØ Core Logic Flow

### 1. AI Medical Analysis
- User describes symptoms via voice/text
- AI analyzes using Gemini API + medical reasoning
- Returns CTAS level (1-5), confidence score, and medical assessment

### 2. Smart Booking Decision
- System evaluates CTAS level + available facilities
- Determines if booking is medically appropriate
- Provides appropriate actions based on urgency

### 3. User Action Based on Decision
- **Emergency (CTAS 1-2)**: No booking, immediate emergency care
- **Urgent (CTAS 3)**: Limited urgent care booking only
- **Standard (CTAS 4-5)**: Full booking options available

## üîí Safety Mechanisms

### Confidence Thresholds
- **CTAS 1**: Requires 95%+ confidence for emergency classification
- **CTAS 2**: Requires 90%+ confidence for urgent classification
- **CTAS 3-5**: Requires 70%+ confidence for standard classification
- **Low Confidence**: Defaults to higher urgency level (safety-first approach)

### Fallback Protocols
1. **AI Service Failure**: Default to CTAS 3 (urgent) with manual assessment recommendation
2. **No Facilities Found**: Always show emergency room option
3. **Ambiguous Symptoms**: Escalate to higher CTAS level
4. **Technical Issues**: Provide 811 Health Link Ontario contact

### Human-in-the-Loop
- Emergency cases trigger immediate human oversight notification
- Urgent cases flag for rapid healthcare provider review
- All AI decisions include confidence scores for provider evaluation
